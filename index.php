    <section class="col-1-4"><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150" width="350" height="150">I hope I didn't brain my damage. How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? Marge, just about everything's a sin.</section>
    <section class="col-1-4"><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150" width="350" height="150">Me fail English? That's unpossible. Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.</section>
    <section class="col-1-4"><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150" width="350" height="150">That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk.</section>
    <section class="col-1-4"><img src="http://placehold.it/350x150" width="350" height="150">I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.</section>
